# Design and Implementation of Syslog Server and NTP Server for University using Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a Syslog server and NTP server for a university network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The Syslog server collects and stores log messages from network devices, while the NTP server provides accurate time synchronization for the network.

## Features

- Syslog server for collecting and storing log messages
- NTP server for accurate time synchronization
- Implementation using Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/darshith-v/Design-and-implement-Syslog-server-and-NTP-Server-for-University-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
2. Install Cisco Packet Tracer on your machine.

## Usage

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Load the project file for the Syslog server and NTP server.
3. Configure the network devices to send log messages to the Syslog server and synchronize time with the NTP server.

## Configuration

- Configure the Syslog server IP address and logging parameters on network devices.
- Configure the NTP server IP address and synchronization settings on network devices.

## Testing

1. Send test log messages from network devices to the Syslog server.
2. Verify that the Syslog server is receiving and storing log messages correctly.
3. Check the time synchronization of network devices with the NTP server.
